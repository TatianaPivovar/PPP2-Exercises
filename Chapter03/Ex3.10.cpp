/*
Write a program that takes an operation followed by two operands and outputs
the result. For example:
    + 100 3.14
    * 4 5
Read the operation into a string called "operation" and use an "if"-statement
to figure out which operation the user wants, for example, if (operation=="+").
Read the operands into variables of type double. Implement this for operations
called +, â€“, *, /, plus, minus, mul, and div with their obvious meanings.
