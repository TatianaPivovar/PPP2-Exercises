/*
Run this program with a variety of inputs. Try small values (e.g., 2 and 3);
try large values (larger than 127, larger than 1000); try negative values;
try 56; try 89; try 128; try non-integer values (e.g., 56.9 and 56.2).
In addition to showing how conversions from double to int and conversions from
int to char are done on your machine, this program shows you what character
(if any) your machine will print for a given integer value.
